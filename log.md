# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 - 8: January 21st - 29th, 2018

**This week's Progress**: Completed Tic-Tac-Toe challenge, refactored many advanced algorithm challenges, began Simon challenge, created a Panel Quiz Attack 25 game to use for my lessons at school, continued the Node.js Shopping Cart project, began diving into MERN projects.

**Thoughts:** I was super focused this past week and didn't really realize it until today. I've been at it for a long long time now, but I can feel the learning has been paying off. Doing these advanced challenges, like Tic-Tac-Toe and Simon, I realize that I'm a lot better off than I previously thought. I was just directing my attention towards the wrong thing (for a learner).

### Day 9: January 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked towards finishing the Node.js Shopping Cart project from Academind.

**Thoughts:** Today felt great. I don't mind the algorithm challenges so much when in small doses, and the FCC challenges are a good exercise for the brain, but building stuff like this is really exciting. I know I'm just following and copying, so I'm not about to jump into my own project just yet, but it gives me inspiration to keep doing the algorithms and challenges. Tomorrow I aim to finish the Simon game (it'll be day 2 of my time with it - hoping to finish in less than 4 hours).

### Day 10: January 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: "Finished" the FCC Simon Game Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Today was good but not great. I spent most of my free time at work taking notes and brainstorming the Simon Game build. I couldn't make the flow work in my head, but also a full teacher's room isn't the best place for concentrating. I worked with a Medium article and Github repo with the challenge completed to put my head on track. I used some of that in my project, so I'm not officially submitting it yet. I'll come back to it this weekend where I'll make it with React. I'll also redo my advanced algorihm challenges to completion because I know I used solutions on some of them (to be honest, fuck prime numbers but I'll figure it out). I'll also remake my calculator app since I used a tutorial for that. I have to fix my TwitchTV API challenge, too, but that I made bespoke it's just got an error.

## Day 11: February 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Academind's Node.js + MongoDB Shopping Cart Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Today was okay. A rough sleep meant I was wiped out after work. I did get two hours in, finishing up the Shopping Cart tutorial and touching back on the MERN Comment Box tutorial. After I learn MERN, I want to go back to the Shopping Cart, do it on my own once, and then see about doing a MERN project, maybe the comment box or a todo app. I also did some brainstorming on how to do my own Simon Game, as I really want to do that with original code.

## Day 12: February 2st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began reading You Don't Know JS and Understand Flaw in TwitchTV API Challenge

**Thoughts:** No actual code committed today due to how busy I was. After work I was able to make it home for an hour break before going off to team-building event for my office, however I committed to only reading as I didn't feel like I had time to put in much concentration. On my way to and from the event I spent that time reading related Medium articles and YDKJS. Even after getting home around 11pm, I have kept reading and did a small bit of coding. I had a brainwave and realized what I needed to do with my TwitchTV API Challenge after some reading. I should be calling functions to check objects for keys based on some info. I'll be putting that in tomorrow, I hope. I'm going to claim it as I did learn some things, but even if this day doesn't really technically count, it doesn't break my streak. Now for some grossly overdue sleep.

## Day 13: February 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring Algorithms and Solved TwitchTV API Issue

**Thoughts:** Exactly like I considered on Day 12, I implemented a solution to my TwitchTV API challenge that allowed for me to take data from two API calls and condense them into one based on some shared data (name of the channel). It was an awesome feeling to put that into work. Where at one time I was frustrated and annoyed that their API works in such a way, now I know I can work with set ups like that! Go me!

## Day 14: February 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue You Don't Know JS and Refactoring Algorithms

**Thoughts:** I did try some coding today with the Simon Game, this time through Reactjs. It was coming along but I kept finding myself writing similar code to the solution I saw last week. Going to give it a few days. Went off to keep refactoring the algorithms instead and do some reading with YDKJS to hopefully shed some light on what other approaches I can take to the challenge.

## Day 15: February 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue with YDKJS and Refactoring Algorithms

**Thoughts:** Not a great day. I got to studying a little later than usual but I was starting off decently. I was refactoring algorithms and things weren't so bad until I hit the regex challenge on FreeCodeCamp called "Spinal tap." I won't lie, I really hate regex. I haven't attempted to learn it yet, but that's because I haven't run into a real world problem where I felt it would solve it. That's really how I get to grip on things the best - real world stuff. What "Spinal tap" told me is that I will just have to take the loss on that challenge and move on because it's far too frustrating to solve without regex and regex is pretty deep and will take a full detour to understand. Seriously, fuck that challenge. Hopefully in the next version of FCC they'll drop it for something else or change the tests for it. 

On the bright side, during the train ride to work in the morning I read YDKJS some more and believe I have found a solution to the Simon Game challenge. Originally I tried to run a for-loop that used a setTimeout call to light up the game buttons. Well I learned more about closure so I'll see if I can properly use closure around that loop to execute that code.

## Day 16: February 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on MERN Stack App - Todos

**Thoughts:** Yesterday I took a day off, pretty much. I did do some reading but I wouldn't count it. I needed rest, I was falling asleep standing up at work. Today I also took a nap but this time I got up afterward and started working. I didn't want to do algorithms so I jumped into another MERN stack app guide. I like this one more than the other because the guide's code is actually legible! The other one, the comment box, is a mess with it's indentation so it's a struggle to read. I'm hoping to finish this tomorrow and begin working on migrating the Buddies project into a MERN build so we can have a real world-like project. It'll also give me the chance to work on features that I never got around to, like rating and reviewing others.

## Day 1７: February ８th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on MERN Stack App - Todos

**Thoughts:** Like yesterday, I continued working on the MERN app. I didn't go very far because I wanted to split my time between that and a new Udemy course I picked up called "The Web Developer Bootcamp." I picked it up because I wanted to go over any concepts that I might have missed and also because it offers a nice guided approach to Node.js and the back-end in general. The back-end part should prove useful. Since I already know a good deal about React, Flux, and Redux, once I reach the end of this course, I should have a good solid understanding for working the front-end in all it's might with my current React knowledge and also understand how the back-end works so that I can better work with APIs. We shall see!

## Day 18: February 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Refactoring Personal Site

**Thoughts:** I worked on revamping my personal website. I want to set it up in an easier to view way, where there's no React-Router in use for navigation of the important stuff. I do want to showcase smaller apps in an interesting way though. Not sure if I'll need router, probably can just do it with component lifecycle calls.

## Day 19: February 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Developer Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Typing out these logs makes it look like I'm aimlessly bouncing around. I guess I'll come around and refocus and just start finishing the tasks I began. I have no forgotten my work, I just want to move from tutorials to building on my own to keep my mind sharp.

## Day 20: February 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished first pass on refactoring personal website and finished Simon Game

**Thoughts:** Made a push today to finish work that I had begun weeks back. The Simon Game especially, because it was hounding me by being the last thing to do on FreeCodeCamp's cirriculm. I took the things I learned from You Don't Know JS and applied them to the project, allowing me to use my own code. I also finished the first pass on my personal website. I changed it to be single page, removed React Router use, and added CSS transitions for displaying my smaller app and API showcase. I plan to add more Redux use to it, add more apps and API use cases to the app showcase, and finish the Japanese translation.

## Day 21: February 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Developer Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Flew through the bootcamp course today. Warmed up with a Todo app in the morning and then pressed on through back-end throughout the day. I was already familiar with back-end, but I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything critical so I skimmed through the lectures, stopping to refresh myself on a handful of things. Currently working on the Yelp-Camp project. I'm poised to finish the course in a day or two. I think I'll build Buddies out in a MEN app just to have something available for the team to use and work on. I'll come back and make it a MERN app later. I may also rebuild Nihon ALT with better React and Redux use since I'll know more about that soon. It can be made MERN later, too.
