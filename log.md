# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 - 8: January 21st - 29th, 2018

**This week's Progress**: Completed Tic-Tac-Toe challenge, refactored many advanced algorithm challenges, began Simon challenge, created a Panel Quiz Attack 25 game to use for my lessons at school, continued the Node.js Shopping Cart project, began diving into MERN projects.

**Thoughts:** I was super focused this past week and didn't really realize it until today. I've been at it for a long long time now, but I can feel the learning has been paying off. Doing these advanced challenges, like Tic-Tac-Toe and Simon, I realize that I'm a lot better off than I previously thought. I was just directing my attention towards the wrong thing (for a learner).

### Day 9: January 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked towards finishing the Node.js Shopping Cart project from Academind.

**Thoughts:** Today felt great. I don't mind the algorithm challenges so much when in small doses, and the FCC challenges are a good exercise for the brain, but building stuff like this is really exciting. I know I'm just following and copying, so I'm not about to jump into my own project just yet, but it gives me inspiration to keep doing the algorithms and challenges. Tomorrow I aim to finish the Simon game (it'll be day 2 of my time with it - hoping to finish in less than 4 hours).

### Day 10: January 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: "Finished" the FCC Simon Game Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Today was good but not great. I spent most of my free time at work taking notes and brainstorming the Simon Game build. I couldn't make the flow work in my head, but also a full teacher's room isn't the best place for concentrating. I worked with a Medium article and Github repo with the challenge completed to put my head on track. I used some of that in my project, so I'm not officially submitting it yet. I'll come back to it this weekend where I'll make it with React. I'll also redo my advanced algorihm challenges to completion because I know I used solutions on some of them (to be honest, fuck prime numbers but I'll figure it out). I'll also remake my calculator app since I used a tutorial for that. I have to fix my TwitchTV API challenge, too, but that I made bespoke it's just got an error.
