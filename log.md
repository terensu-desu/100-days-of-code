# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 - 8: January 21st - 29th, 2018

**This week's Progress**: Completed Tic-Tac-Toe challenge, refactored many advanced algorithm challenges, began Simon challenge, created a Panel Quiz Attack 25 game to use for my lessons at school, continued the Node.js Shopping Cart project, began diving into MERN projects.

**Thoughts:** I was super focused this past week and didn't really realize it until today. I've been at it for a long long time now, but I can feel the learning has been paying off. Doing these advanced challenges, like Tic-Tac-Toe and Simon, I realize that I'm a lot better off than I previously thought. I was just directing my attention towards the wrong thing (for a learner).

### Day 9: January 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked towards finishing the Node.js Shopping Cart project from Academind.

**Thoughts:** Today felt great. I don't mind the algorithm challenges so much when in small doses, and the FCC challenges are a good exercise for the brain, but building stuff like this is really exciting. I know I'm just following and copying, so I'm not about to jump into my own project just yet, but it gives me inspiration to keep doing the algorithms and challenges. Tomorrow I aim to finish the Simon game (it'll be day 2 of my time with it - hoping to finish in less than 4 hours).

### Day 10: January 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: "Finished" the FCC Simon Game Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Today was good but not great. I spent most of my free time at work taking notes and brainstorming the Simon Game build. I couldn't make the flow work in my head, but also a full teacher's room isn't the best place for concentrating. I worked with a Medium article and Github repo with the challenge completed to put my head on track. I used some of that in my project, so I'm not officially submitting it yet. I'll come back to it this weekend where I'll make it with React. I'll also redo my advanced algorihm challenges to completion because I know I used solutions on some of them (to be honest, fuck prime numbers but I'll figure it out). I'll also remake my calculator app since I used a tutorial for that. I have to fix my TwitchTV API challenge, too, but that I made bespoke it's just got an error.

## Day 11: February 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Academind's Node.js + MongoDB Shopping Cart Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Today was okay. A rough sleep meant I was wiped out after work. I did get two hours in, finishing up the Shopping Cart tutorial and touching back on the MERN Comment Box tutorial. After I learn MERN, I want to go back to the Shopping Cart, do it on my own once, and then see about doing a MERN project, maybe the comment box or a todo app. I also did some brainstorming on how to do my own Simon Game, as I really want to do that with original code.

## Day 12: February 2st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began reading You Don't Know JS and Understand Flaw in TwitchTV API Challenge

**Thoughts:** No actual code committed today due to how busy I was. After work I was able to make it home for an hour break before going off to team-building event for my office, however I committed to only reading as I didn't feel like I had time to put in much concentration. On my way to and from the event I spent that time reading related Medium articles and YDKJS. Even after getting home around 11pm, I have kept reading and did a small bit of coding. I had a brainwave and realized what I needed to do with my TwitchTV API Challenge after some reading. I should be calling functions to check objects for keys based on some info. I'll be putting that in tomorrow, I hope. I'm going to claim it as I did learn some things, but even if this day doesn't really technically count, it doesn't break my streak. Now for some grossly overdue sleep.
